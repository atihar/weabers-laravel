                                    <p>Creating your app from scratch can feel overwhelming and complicated at first. Since the process is long, project leaders and software engineering directors need to know the steps to successfully creating an app. Knowing how to go ahead is like having a map for creating a successful app project. 
                                        Getting this process right is vital in order to stay ahead and avoid any pitfalls that cause your app to fail. 
                                                                    
                                This is why in this article, we’re bringing you a thorough step-by-step guide to creating your app, from its inception to steering to success after you’ve released it. <br><br>

                                    <b>Setting product goal</b><br>
                                    Your app project won’t be successful unless you set your project goals and track their attainment using a specific set of criteria from the start. What you want to acheive through this 
                                        app, who are going to be the users, how they will use this etc. such objective's rough idea comes out in this stage. Cause blueprint of the product is this stage.

                                    <b>Sketch of the screens (low fidelity)</b><br>
                                    Before you lay the foundation for your app, create a rough sketch of your idea first. App idea sketches are simple drawings that show what your app should entail, how it will work, and what you want it to look like. 
                                    
                                    They make the idea tangible for yourself and other team members you want to convey it to. 
                                    
                                    This step is a risk-free way of developing an app idea that helps you get a basic outlook of your app.<br><br>

                                        Finally, make a separate screen preview for each page of the app and start listing ideas on the side of each sketch and keep drawing until you run out of ideas. 
                                        When you’ve put down all your initial ideas, you can start refining them. 
                                        This means writing the first draft of your app’s feature list. Keep in mind that you’re still working on the conceptual level.

                                          Competitive market research is a critical step of successful mobile app development that comes after you’ve sketched out your app idea. Weabers will help you to define <br><br>
        
                                          Competition analysis: This gives you key insights into your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses in terms of online presence, content marketing strategy, and app store listings. You want to look at average ratings, user reviews, and how frequently they update apps to determine what tactics deliver the best results. <br><br>
                                          Understanding prospective users:  Directly ask prospective users what they think of similar apps to confirm your assumptions about competitors. Collect as much feedback as possible to make educated decisions on app design, critical features, and user experience standards. <br><br>
                                          Industry analysis: Understand the current state of the industry so your app can address its specific pain points. You can collect hard data from the latest industry trend reports and by attending industry conferences and key events.  
                                           <br><br>
        
                                          <b>Writing features in technical requirement document</b><br>
                                          A technical requirements document lists all of the features you want in your app in one place.
        
                                            It will describe the features that are unique to your app and highlight which ones are a priority, so that any developer who takes on the project has a clear idea of what the app is about. 
        
                                            The complexity of the technical requirements will set a benchmark for choosing a developer. <br><br>
        
                                            A good way to go about this is to try to imagine how users interact with your app, and then write it down, step by step. 
        
                                            Picture what signing in to your app for the first time and browsing through its content should feel like and let that guide you as you develop the technical requirements document. 
        
                                            Describe what features the app navigation needs and how the user interacts with media galleries, videos, and social media. 
        
                                            Mention if the app requires access to specific hardware, such as cameras or microphones, and make sure to list any special features such as analytics, payment system, booking, or chat support. 
        
                                            After you’ve listed all the features that you want to include in your app, point out the most important ones, as those will require special attention.
        
                                            <br><br>
                                            Now that you have the visual design and the technical requirements of your app penned down, you’re will have the idea what you will get as product. 
                                            <br><br>
        
                                            <b>Interface Design (high fidelity)</b><br>
                                            You will then need to create a visual design of what your app looks and feels like to the user. 
        
                                            The process of designing an app consists of creating app-specific wireframes and building design mockups on top of them. 
        
                                            Think of wireframes as app structures — they tell you how users will navigate through the app. <br><br>
